## Version 1.0.12

Adding support for v9

Changed the images to grayscale if the player is away and changed the red border to gray.  Red was kind of giving the impression that something was wrong, and there wasn't anything wrong, they player was just not active.

Hotkeys are now being handled by Foundry, as such... I can return the shift space functionality without causing issues.  All this is editable so iyou can change the keys depending on what suits you best.

## Version 1.0.11

Added option to turn Shift Space back on.

## Version 1.0.10

Rebuilt the app, the interface should refresh properly and keep track of the players that are away a little better.  Second app I created so there was a lot I could do better.

Changed the styling for away and back, so instead of relying on text, there's now a big red and green band on the left side so you can check easily who's back.  As well as adding a check for those players that have returned.

Added option to customize the away and back messages.

Added the option to add a specific away message when using the chat command.

Added button to the player display to activate break time so you don't have to relay on the hotkey.

## Version 1.0.9

Added support for lib DF Hotkeys so that you can customize what key will activate breaktime.  Unfortunately this means you can no longer use shift space as the space key is a bit of a protected key.  I've changed it to Shift-Home.  Hopefully this isn't a huge transition.  And was kind of needed to extract it from being so closely linked to pausing the game.

Which leads into the next change, you can not set if you want breaktime to automatically set the game pause.  And pausing and unpasing can work while still waiting for people to return.  So you can continue to do things while breaktime is active.

## Version 1.0.7
Adding support for 0.8.x

## Version 1.0.6
Added support for chat commands
