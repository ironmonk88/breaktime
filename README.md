# Break Time
Foundry VTT module to show when players have returned from a break or to display when a player is stepping out for a second.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
To open the away screen hold down the shift key before pressing the space key to pause the game.  Each player should see the dialog screen and can press the button at the bottom to register when they're back from they're break.  Unpausing the game will close the dialog, and closing the dialog will un pause the game.

Players can also show when they've stepped away for a second by pressing the doot icon on the token menu.  This will send a message to the chat window (if a message has been filled in) and display the player with an empty dot and a door beside their name.
